To simplify development and deployment, most developers want everything in the same artifact, so you'd ideally put your Angular app “inside” your Spring Boot app, right? But what if you could create your Angular app as a standalone app and make cross-origin requests to your API? Hey, guess what, you can do both!

Most front-end developers are used to having their apps standalone and making cross-origin requests to APIs. The beauty of having a client app that can point to a server app is you can point it to any server and it makes it easy to test your current client code against other servers (e.g. test, staging, production).
